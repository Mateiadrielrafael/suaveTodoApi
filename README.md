# Suave todo api

Todo api I made to learn suave. Inspired by [something similar made by a friend in typescript](https://github.com/BlueGhostGH/todoapi)

## Running it

To run it you need to:

1. Have the dotnet cli, paket and docker installed
2. Be on a linux distro
3. Build and run the docker container from the db folder
4. Install dependencies with paket:
   ```sh
   paket restore
   ```
5. Run the project with:
   ```sh
   dotnet run
   ```
6. Hope it doesn't break

## Contributing

Fork, write some code and open a pr... I have no idea why every repo has a section like this in the readme...

## License

You can see it yourself in `LICENSE`, no good reason to copy paste it here.

## Contributors

When I'll have some time I'll add all-contributors to this, but long story short I'm the only contributor to this. (I know, I know, really hard to belive people aren't too keen on contributing on a todo api)

## Why did I use...

### Why did I use sueve

Because I don't know anything else

### Why did I use docker

Because I don't know how to install postgres on my system

### Why did I use `F#`

Because I couldn't get any haskell extensions for vscode to install

### Why did I use paket

Because everyone else seems to use it

### Why is this so long

good question
